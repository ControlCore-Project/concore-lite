# Developer Guidelines

This is a discussion page to help the developers get started soon. 

# Documentation

Please follow the CONTROL-CORE documentation through the [ReadTheDocs](https://control-core.readthedocs.io/).

Please make sure to document any new module or contribution in its README. If your change will affect how a user will use any of CONTROL-CORE's modules, it should be reflected in the respective README.


# Commit logs

Please try to write meaningful commit messages.


# Requests for Enhancement (RFE) and bugs

Have you got requests for enhancements or encountered a bug? Please open an issue in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/concore/issues) if it is not already reported there.

If you have questions and clarifications that are not bug reports, please use our [Discussions forum](https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/concore/discussions).


# Commits and pull requests

New contributors are encouraged to submit pull requests, rather than directly committing even when you have committer access. Another developer can then review and merge your pull request.
